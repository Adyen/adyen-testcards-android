## New
- For favorites, an icon is displayed in the front of the row.

## Fixed
- Spaces are no longer included when autofilling a number. Thanks to @dhartwich1991!
- For cards, "n/a" is no longer autofilled when the security code is not required.
- When removing input after autofilling, there is no longer an empty tooltip shown.
